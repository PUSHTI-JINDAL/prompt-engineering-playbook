# Role-Based Prompt Example

**Prompt:**
Act like a poet and write a short poem about the friendship between the sun and the moon.


**AI Output:**
The sun greets dawn with golden hue,

The moon whispers back in silver blue.

Apart in time, yet close in heart,

Two cosmic friends, though worlds apart.

In endless dance they weave their light,

A tender bond in day and night.


**Why it works:**
Roleâ€‘based prompting tells the AI **how to think before responding**.  
Here, saying "Act like a poet" makes the AI adopt a creative perspective, influencing its style and word choice.
